User asked me to read and store the content at: https://x.com/nateliason/status/2017636775347331276

I attempted to fetch the URL but x.com returned an error due to privacy-related extensions or access restrictions. The fetch returned:

"Something went wrong, but don’t fret — let’s give it another shot. Some privacy related extensions may cause issues on x.com. Please disable them and try again."

Next steps:
- If the user can paste the tweet text or an image of it, I will summarize and store it in MEMORY.md and memory/ as requested.
- If the user prefers, I can try fetching again via a different route or use a browser snapshot (requires interactive flow).

Stored at memory/2026-01-31_nateliason_post.md

Actions I will take when content is available:
- Summarize the post into 2-3 key bullets.
- Add a short personal memo: why it matters for TrendCurator (product/UX/workflow lessons).
- Save a copy in memory/YYYY-MM-DD as daily note and append a short line to MEMORY.md.

If you want me to proceed now, paste the tweet text or image and I’ll summarize and record it.
